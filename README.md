This repository contains the Python and R code used to analyze TDNAseq and BarSeq data in Trichoderma atroviride.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to analyze genetic data from *Trichoderma atroviride* using **TDNAseq** and **BarSeq** techniques. The repository includes:
- Mapping of reads to the genome.

- Annotation of regions containing insertions.

- Counting of barcodes inserted into the genome.

- Calculate the fitness associated with each gene.

- Smear plots of the fitness comparison in R.

## 🔧 Setting Up the Conda Environment for RBTDNAseq
To run this project, you need to set up a Conda environment with all the required packages. Follow the steps below to create, export, and activate the environment.

### 🐍 Prerequisites
Anaconda or Miniconda installed

# 📦 Step-by-Step Installation
1. Create the environment
```bash
conda create -n rbtdnaseq_env python=3.7.6
```
3. Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate rbtdnaseq_env
```
4. Install required packages
```bash
conda install -c defaults -c conda-forge -c bioconda \
  biopython=1.76 \
  numpy=1.18.5 \
  pandas=1.0.5 \
  scipy=1.5.0 \
  matplotlib=3.2.2 \
  statsmodels=0.11.1 \
  blast=2.2.30
```
5. Export the environment (optional but recommended)
After installing everything, export the environment to a YAML file to ensure reproducibility:
```bash
conda env export > tnseq.yml
```
You can version this tnseq.yml file with your repository so others can recreate the exact environment.

🚀 Recreating the Environment from tnseq.yml
To create the same environment on another machine or share it with collaborators:
```bash
conda env create -f tnseq.yml
conda activate rbtdnaseq_env
```
## 🧪 Script Descriptions for RB-TDNAseq analysis
Each script requires a metadata file passed with the -m or --metafile flag. Our metadata files are customized and stored in the metadata directory. **For full details on parameters and file formats, refer to the original repo: stcoradetti/TnSeq-pipeline.**

### RBseq_Map_Insertions.py
This script maps insertion reads from TnSeq experiments to a reference genome using BLAST. It processes barcode structures, identifies junction sequences, filters ambiguous insertions, and creates a dataset of uniquely mapped mutants for downstream analysis.

Inputs:
A metadata file with sample information, read models, insertion sequence details, genome BLAST database path, and annotation files.

Example usage:
```bash
python RBseq_Map_Insertions.py --metafile metadata/my_experiment.tsv
```
Key Outputs:
POOL_poolfile: Mapped, unambiguous insertions.

POOL_poolfile_ambiguous: Barcodes with multiple possible mappings.

TNSEQ_FILE_blastGenome.txt: Raw BLAST hits against the genome.

Log files with detailed processing information.

**See the metadata folder for custom metadata examples.**
